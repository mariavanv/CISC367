Scale:

"Unfamiliar"/"Familiar"/"Pretty good"/"Expert"

No idea what it is: Tuples, list comprehensions, decorators

Needs work: Unittests, file handling, exception handling, lambdas


Overall: I am familiar/good with all of these things in java (except decorators, lambdas, tuples, and list comprehensions).
Definitely need brushing up on python syntax. Most things I could do pretty easily in

    Dictionaries: familiar
    Sets: familiar 
    Tuples: Unfamiliar

    Conditionals/If statements: pretty good
    While Loops: pretty good
    For loops: pretty good
    List comprehensions: unfamiliar
    Functions: pretty good
    Classes and Objects: pretty good
    Importing modules: pretty good
    Using the unittest module and writing assertions: familiar in java, no idea in python
    File handling: familiar
